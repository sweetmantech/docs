# Welcome to In•Process

Use the In•Process API to build applications that interact with the protocol. Create moments, manage collections, browse timelines, and integrate with the decentralized creative platform.

## What is In•Process?

In•Process is a Web3-native platform for documenting and monetizing the creative journey—not just the final product. Artists, builders, and creatives can upload their work-in-progress (writing, music, visuals, links, embeds, or video) and mint it onchain to a collective timeline.

This documentation will help you integrate with the In•Process API to build applications that interact with the protocol.
