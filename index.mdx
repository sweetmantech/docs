# Welcome to In Process

In Process is a Web3-native platform for documenting and monetizing the creative journey—not just the final product. Artists, builders, and creatives can upload their work-in-progress (writing, music, visuals, links, embeds, or video) and mint it onchain to a collective timeline.

## What is In Process?

In Process is a living archive of artistic evolution, where your community, fans, and patrons can collect, comment, and support work as it unfolds. It's a decentralized, artist-owned platform that focuses on process over polish, with permanent onchain documentation and monetization of in-progress work. Built on Base with support for both Web2 and Web3 users.

This documentation will help you integrate with the In Process API to build applications that interact with the protocol.
