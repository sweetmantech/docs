## Overview

The Audio Stream API enables streaming audio content from decentralized storage protocols like Arweave and IPFS. It acts as a proxy that:

- Converts `ar://` and `ipfs://` URLs to fetchable gateway URLs
- Supports HTTP Range requests for seeking within audio files
- Returns proper headers for audio players to function correctly

## Supported URL Formats

| Protocol | Format | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Arweave | `ar://` | `ar://abc123xyz...` |
| IPFS | `ipfs://` | `ipfs://QmXyz...` |
| HTTPS | `https://` | `https://arweave.net/abc123...` |

## Range Request Support

The endpoint supports HTTP Range headers, allowing audio players to seek to specific positions in the audio file. When a range request is made and supported by the origin:

- Returns `206 Partial Content` status
- Includes `Content-Range` header indicating the byte range
- Enables efficient streaming without downloading the entire file

## Example Usage

### Basic Request

```bash
curl "https://api.inprocess.world/api/audio/stream?url=ar://your-arweave-tx-id"
```

### With Range Header (for seeking)

```bash
curl -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" \
  "https://api.inprocess.world/api/audio/stream?url=ar://your-arweave-tx-id"
```

### In an HTML Audio Element

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://api.inprocess.world/api/audio/stream?url=ar://your-arweave-tx-id" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```
