## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.inprocess.world/api
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints are **public** and do not require authentication. You can browse timelines and collections without providing any authorization headers.

Currently available public endpoints:
- `GET /timeline` - Browse moments from timelines
- `GET /collections` - Browse collections

Some endpoints require authentication using an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header. These endpoints are used for creating, updating, and managing moments and collections.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Navigate to the [In•Process API Keys Management Page](https://inprocess.world/manage/api-keys)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Create a new API key and copy it immediately (it's only shown once)

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for authenticated requests:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.inprocess.world/api/moment/collect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: art_sk_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

<Note>
  You can also create API keys programmatically using the [Create API Key endpoint](/api-reference/artists/api-keys/create).
